A party has one or more objective *Objectives* defining the outcome of a
game.
Currently there are two objectives available (see resources):

- KillParties
- KillCreature


## KillParties

This objectives is completed when all players of all other competing parties
are dead.


## KillCreature

This objective is fullfilled if a `creature` has been killed `count`
times (see resources).
Note that only the player (and respectively his party) where the killing blow
originaed gets the kill.
