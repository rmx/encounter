We try to adhere to the following rules when writing JavaScript code:

 - We use four spaces for each level of indentation.

 - We do not rely on Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI), and always include
   semicolons where appropriate.

 - When declaring multiple vars, we use a single 'var' on the first line and
   commas as contination, and align the equal signs in a single column:

       var foo    = this.props.foo
         , barBaz = this.props.bar;

 - When declaring object literals, we keep the colon attached to the field
   name, but align the right hand side in a single column, eg.

       var obj =
           { foo:     1
           , barBaz:  2
           };



Types which are serialized to JSON and stored on the server (rmx/types/*):

 - Use snakeCase for field names.

 - Add 'Id' suffix to fields which contain Ids of other top-level objects
   (soundId, iconId, ..).

 - For enums, use the dasherized class name (eg. SpellDamage ->
   "spell-damage").
